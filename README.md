## Academic Integrity Notice

### Important: Do Not Copy or Reuse This Code

As a student at Carnegie Mellon University, I am committed to upholding the principles of academic integrity. This repository is for personal reference and portfolio purposes only. 

If you are currently enrolled in 16-831 Introduction to Robot Learning or a similar course:

- **Do not copy, reproduce, or submit any code from this repository as your own work.**
- **Do not use these solutions to circumvent the learning process of your coursework.**
- **Consult your course's collaboration policy before viewing this repository.**

Remember, the goal of your coursework is to learn and understand the material, not just to complete assignments. Using others' solutions undermines this goal and violates CMU's Academic Integrity Policy.

### Upholding Academic Integrity

- Produce your own original work for all assignments and projects.
- Collaborate only when explicitly permitted by your instructor.
- Properly cite any references or sources you use in your work.
- If unsure about what's allowed, always ask your instructor for clarification.

Violations of academic integrity can result in serious consequences, including course failure and disciplinary action.

For more information, please refer to [CMU's Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html).
